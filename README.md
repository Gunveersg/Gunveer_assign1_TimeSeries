# Gunveer_assign1_TimeSeries
## Procedure used:
The main problem assigned was to predict values of para 9 tp para 13 for the 10th year of each sub section of the full length road. 
For this, I decided to use an extra-trees regressor model by taking Para 1-8 and year as inputs in each section to perform regression upon this dataset and then calculated the rmse value.
